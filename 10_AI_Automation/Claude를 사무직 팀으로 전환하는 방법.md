description: "대부분의 사용자는 Claude를 단순 채팅 도구로만 사용하지만, 한 저장소로 모든 업무를 자동화할 수 있다. 반복적인 작업을 제거하고 지속적인 협업 환경을 구축하여 생산성을 극대화한다. 이는 기억력이 없는 프리랜서가 아닌 완전한 사무직 팀을 만드는 방법을 제시한다."

brief: "대부분의 사용자가 Claude를 단순한 채팅 도구로 사용하는 반면, Anthropic이 공개한 오픈소스 저장소는 Claude를 영업, 마케팅, 재무 분석 등 전문화된 사무 직원들로 구성된 팀으로 전환시킵니다. 이는 매번 프롬프트를 새로 작성할 필요 없이 각 역할에 맞는 워크플로우와 도메인 지식이 사전 탑재된 '부서를 고용하는' 방식의 접근법을 제공합니다."

Here is what almost everyone does with Claude.

They open a chat. They paste a task. They get an answer. They close the tab. Next time they start from zero and re-explain everything all over again.

That is one freelancer with amnesia. Useful, but small.

There is a different way to run it. Anthropic quietly open-sourced a repo that turns Claude into a set of specialized office roles. A sales rep. A marketer. A financial analyst. A legal reviewer. A data analyst. Each one comes pre-loaded with the workflows, the domain knowledge, and the tool connections that role actually needs.

You are not prompting from scratch anymore. You are hiring a department.

This is the full walkthrough. Every step, in order. By the end you will have Claude running like a small company instead of a search box.

# What this repo actually is

The repo is [anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins). It is a free, open-source marketplace of role-based plugins for Claude Cowork, Anthropic's agentic desktop app.

Each plugin turns Claude into one narrow specialist. Inside every plugin there are three things doing the work:

- **Skills** — the domain knowledge and best practices for that role. Claude pulls them automatically when they are relevant. You do not invoke them.
- **Commands** — ready-made workflows you trigger with a slash, like /sales:call-prep or /data:write-query.
- **Connections** — the tools that role plugs into. The sales plugin reaches for your CRM. The finance plugin reaches for your data warehouse. The marketing plugin reaches for Canva and your analytics.

This is the same foundation Anthropic built Claude for Legal and Claude for Financial Services on top of. You are getting the base layer those paid products are made from, for free.

# The roles you can hire

The repo ships with a full org chart. Each is one command to install.

- **Productivity** — tasks, calendars, daily routine, personal context. Plugs into Slack, Notion, Asana, Linear, Jira, ClickUp, Microsoft 365.
- **Sales** — account research, call prep, pipeline, cold outreach, competitive analysis. Plugs into HubSpot, Close, Clay, ZoomInfo, Fireflies.
- **Marketing** — content, campaigns, brand voice, competitor sweeps, channel reporting, SEO audits. Plugs into Canva, Figma, HubSpot, Klaviyo, Ahrefs, SimilarWeb.
- **Customer support** — ticket triage, reply templates, escalations, turning solved tickets into help-center articles. Plugs into Intercom, HubSpot, Guru.
- **Product management** — specs, roadmaps, user research synthesis, stakeholder updates. Plugs into Linear, Figma, Amplitude, Pendo.
- **Finance** — journal entries, reconciliations, statements, variance analysis, month-end close, audit support. Plugs into Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery.
- **Legal** — contract review, NDA triage, risk assessment, templated responses. Plugs into Box, Egnyte, Microsoft 365.
- **Data** — queries, SQL, stats, dashboards, result checks before you publish. Plugs into Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Hex.
- **Enterprise search** — one search across your email, chat, docs, and internal wikis.

Pick the ones that match the jobs you actually need done. You do not install all of them. You build the team you need.

## Step 1: Get Claude Cowork

These plugins are built for Cowork, Anthropic's agentic desktop app, though they also run in Claude Code.

Download Claude Desktop from [claude.com/download](https://claude.com/download). Open the Cowork tab. This is where Claude stops being a chat window and starts touching real files, real tools, and real workflows.

## Step 2: Add the marketplace

Cowork has a terminal. Add the plugin marketplace with one command:

```powershell
claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins
```

That points Claude at the full catalog of roles. You only do this once.

## Step 3: Hire your first worker

Install the role you need most. Say you want a sales rep:

```powershell
claude plugin install sales@knowledge-work-plugins
```

Swap sales for any role: marketing, finance, legal, data, product-management, customer-support, productivity. The plugin activates automatically the moment it is installed.

Start with one. Get a feel for it before you build the whole department.

## Step 4: Put it to work standalone

Every plugin works on day one without connecting a single outside tool. You just give it the raw material.

Trigger a workflow with a slash command. A few real ones:

- /sales:call-prep — hand it a company name, get back a full pre-call brief
- /data:write-query — describe what you want to know, get the SQL
- /marketing:seo-audit — point it at a page, get keyword gaps and fixes

Paste your notes, upload a CSV, or just describe the situation. The skills behind the plugin already know how that role does the job, so you skip the part where you explain what a good output looks like.

## Step 5: Connect its tools to supercharge it

This is where the worker goes from competent to dangerous.

Each plugin has tool connections built in. Connect the sales plugin to your CRM and it stops asking you to paste pipeline data and starts pulling it. Connect the finance plugin to your data warehouse and it reconciles against real numbers. Connect marketing to your analytics and reports build themselves.

In Cowork, open Connectors and authorize the tools that role uses. Standalone is the intern. Connected is the senior hire.

## Step 6: Build the rest of the team

Now repeat Step 3 for every role you need. Install marketing, finance, data, whatever your work actually requires.

Once they are in, they work together in the same session. Your data worker pulls the numbers, your finance worker reconciles them, your marketing worker turns the result into a report. One operator, a full cross-functional team, no payroll.

## Step 7: Make them yours

The default plugins are a strong starting point. The real edge is customizing them for how you actually work.

Use the **cowork-plugin-management** plugin, the meta-tool in the repo built for exactly this. Tell it your tools, your terminology, your process, and it reshapes a plugin to fit. Plugins are just markdown files, so you can edit them directly, fork the repo, and keep your own private versions.

This is the difference between Claude that knows how a generic sales rep works and Claude that knows how your company sells.

# What you have after these steps

Before this, Claude is a chatbot you ask questions. One at a time. Starting over every session.

After this, Claude is a building full of specialists. A sales rep who preps every call. A marketer who runs the campaign. A data analyst who writes the queries. A finance lead who closes the month. All pulling from your real tools, all working in one place, all running off a free open-source repo.

Same subscription. Completely different operation.

The model did not change. The setup did.

And the setup is exactly what almost nobody bothers to do.

Most people will read all seven steps and install nothing.

The ones who run that first command today will be operating a company-in-a-box by the end of the week. And they are not going back to a single chat box.

If this was useful, head to my profile and follow. I write about AI, Claude, and systems that actually run.
